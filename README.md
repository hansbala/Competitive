# Competitive
All code I submit to competitive coding websites usually ends up here

# Editor
I use far manager as my primary editor with absolutely no plugins.
This is why you might see irregular indenting, as it's easy to backspace
through tabs in Far Manager.

# License
As you might expect, this is distributed with WTFPL license. Do what you
want with it!
